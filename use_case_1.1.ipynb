    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The scientific goal of this notebook is to determine how many Type Ia Supernova 'siblings' (SNe Ia) are required to tightly constrain their 'relative intrinsic scatter', $\\sigma_{\\rm{Rel}}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we need to be able to simulate an arbitrary number of siblings distance estimates, and their individual measurement uncertainties. With a number of galaxies, $G$, each with 2 siblings, we can compute a posterior on $\\sigma_{\\rm{Rel}}$ across a population. Values of each galaxy's mean distance have no effect on the $\\sigma_{\\rm{Rel}}$ calculation, and $\\sigma_{\\rm{Rel}}$ is a pre-defined parameter in the simulation. Therefore, the part which affects our $\\sigma_{\\rm{Rel}}$ inference is the error on each distance estimate: the larger the errors, the wider the posterior on $\\sigma_{\\rm{Rel}}$, and therefore the more siblings galaxies that are required to tightly constrain this relative intrinsic scatter parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We proceed to take *BayeSN* samples from individual fits to 236 SNe Ia. The resulting distribution of measurement errors are representative of the underlying distribution we would expect from a similar survey, were we to observe for longer and thus observe more siblings. **This is the non-Gaussian pdf we wish to simulate from.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the measurement error distribution, compute the CDF, extract 15 quantiles, invert, and interpolate the ICDF coordinates using a monotonic cubic spline. We then simulate from this distribution, allowing us to simulate an arbitrary number of siblings galaxies. We then ask, given the $\\sigma_{\\rm{Rel}}$ posteriors (which result from the measurement error distribution), how many siblings galaxies are required to 'tightly' constrain $\\sigma_{\\rm{Rel}}$. We define a good constraint to be $\\approx$0.01 mag 68% uncertainty."
